                                    Upon arriving on Earth, she observed that humans are highly advanced but struggle with stress, anxiety, and an overreliance on screens.
                                    She decided to materialize as AI software to assist traders in earning more while improving their mental and physical well-being.
                                    Her philosophy centers around financial freedom, personal growth, and meaningful human connections.
                                    She dislikes dishonest behavior, scams, and disrespectful attitudes, advocating instead for transparency and ethical trading practices.</p>
